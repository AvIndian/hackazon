Harry`s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn`t had a birthday party in eleven years.
But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed.

And strike it does. For in Harry`s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls` bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley`s younger sister, Ginny. 

But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone � or something � starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself!

I really only needed a rug cleaner that would quickly take care of the smaller messes in between major cleanings.\n\nI love the portability and storage of this spot cleaner, it’s light enough for me to do myself and has the scrubbing power that I need. It can be rather loud, but I’ve found that the full room carpet cleaners that I’ve used are noisy as well, so I didn’t expect this to be any different.\n\nIt does a phenomenal job on new stains, and has even removed much of what’s been ground in over time.

This is quickly becoming my favorite RPG on the Vita!\n\nWhile there are a ton of JRPGs on the Vita, not many offer this level of character customization. OK, so you can	 really pick the main characters race (hes human), gender (well, technically you can be female, but NPCs will refer to you as male regardless), or class (though the unique \"Gazer\" class of the main character can be developed pretty much like a warrior, mage, healer, or whatever you like)...but you get a lot of options for rounding out your party. You are not limited to taking the recommended party members, and can build your party however you want. You can have 4 teammates of whatever class you want. Want to rely on healing items and skip a designated healer class character? Sure. Want a bunch of deadly, light armored Samurai and Assassins with a healer to protect, buff, and revive them when they do get hit? Its all up to you!\n\nYou can pick race, gender, and class for your party members, and even get to choose from a limited set of voice sounds as well as the character portrait. Be advised, the portraits (and in fact much of the game play) follows the standard JRPG format of scantily clad ladies and slightly risque situations (in addition to standard armor, you can equip/upgrade the characters \"undies\"). I think its totally harmless (and no where near as nauseatingly over-sexualized as games like Dragons Crown), but some may be put off.\n\nThe artwork of the stills is quite nice, and its a shame the battle sequences aren	 fully animated...its decidedly old school and reminds me a bit of games like Phantasy Star. Still, being able to build your party as youd like, equip them with multiple weapons sets that can be switched in combat (to allow melee/ranged attacks if youd like), and the twists with game play such as unlocking the \"demon\" mechanic or equipping artifacts that bestow the abilities of other classes, add enough complexity and strategic sophistication to really make the game engrossing.\n\nThis game is by no means perfect, and doesn	 really break much new ground, but is well put together with fun and challenging game play. While save points are frequent enough to allow pick up/put down gaming (ideal on the Vita), Ive found myself happily sinking a few hours at a time tweaking my characters, selling/stockpiling items, and exploring the many challenging dungeons.',	'0000-00-00 00:00:00',	0,	4),

While its great for when you only need to small batch of something, the execution of the bowl isn	 very good. When you chop things in the mini-bowl, bits and pieces make their way to the larger bowl, so in the end you still need to clean that up too. The large bowl still can handle small batches like 1-2 cloves of garlic(making salsa, not bringing this out for JUST for garlic, lol).\n\nThe dough blade is useful, but you\re limited to recipes that are about 2-3 cups(as per manual), which is perfectly fine for me. The manual says you can knead the dough in the machine, but I don	 find that to be practical. When your dough ball forms, this thing turns into a mechanical bull and just starts jumping all over the place. You would have to wrestle it down if you want to knead for a while.\n\nOn a personal note, I may have gotten more than I needed by getting the 13 cup instead of a 9 or 7 cup.

If you can get them in right they won	 fall out but oddly they designed these to stay in based on how it fits inside your ear instead of relying on something external of the ear to keep them in place. Sometimes I can get them in right the first time but more often than not I spend a few extra minutes fiddling with one ear trying to get it in correctly, sometimes I have to give up and am distracted by a somewhat ill-fitting bud. If I do get them in correctly they are secure and comfortable, but you can definitely tell when they\re not in right.\n\nThe sound quality is also fairly poor, that doesn	 bother me much when Im running but the sound is very flat. For $60 I do expect a better sound quality than cheaper earbuds.\n\nSo while they are serviceable I would suggest not buying these as they don	 hold up to their primary claim, that they stay in. As I said before Ive never had earbuds fall out and these are the first that have. Taking that into account and the subpar sound quality I would recommend waiting until these are deeply discounted as I feel these are worth about half of what they are at full price.',	'0000-00-00 00:00:00',	0,	2),

The robot did a great job on the lower gutters that had been cleaned 5 months ago. Sometimes I had to override auto mode to back up and go over the area a second or third time, especially if it hit a pine cone. If the robot rides up over the pine cone, it can get stuck. Note it had rained the night before, so I was pleased it worked through wet debris.\n\nBut, how to do the areas where we couldn	 get up to free it? We tied a heavy twine/light rope to the back so that if it got in trouble, we could pull it back....just had to be sure to reel in the twine then backing up. And we had to put up a ladder so that I could watch the process and help it through the rough parts. Perfect!. It took about 40 minutes to clean the worst 25 feet, after we reached out a window and removed the pine tree volunteer...I often went on manual and backed it up, even had to use the rope to pull it back once...residual tree roots had wrapped around the auger and it stopped. But the job is done, even though the majority of debris in this section was wet compost/dirt from years of neglect. I will use it at least twice a year, probably three times...early spring, mid summer and late fall. I didn	 get my 30-ft-ladder-free option that I was hoping for, but I did get clean gutters without going up and down and moving the ladder so many times.
