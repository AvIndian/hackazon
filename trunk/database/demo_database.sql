Harry`s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn`t had a birthday party in eleven years.
But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed.

And strike it does. For in Harry`s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls` bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley`s younger sister, Ginny. 

But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone � or something � starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself!

Between the dog and the husband spilling coffee as he walks into the bedroom (as well as other food products), we had spots. I really only needed a rug cleaner that would quickly take care of the smaller messes in between major cleanings.\n\nI love the portability and storage of this spot cleaner, it’s light enough for me to do myself and has the scrubbing power that I need. It can be rather loud, but I’ve found that the full room carpet cleaners that I’ve used are noisy as well, so I didn’t expect this to be any different.\n\nIt does a phenomenal job on new stains, and has even removed much of what’s been ground in over time. The BIGGEST plus for me was the motorized hand-held brush, as I was also able to clean the carpeted floor mats in my car. WIN-WIN\n\nOverall, it is saving me money by allowing me to extend the time between major carpet cleanings!',	'2014-07-28 11:06:29',	0,	5),

This is quickly becoming my favorite RPG on the Vita!\n\nWhile there are a ton of JRPGs on the Vita, not many offer this level of character customization. OK, so you can	 really pick the main characters race (hes human), gender (well, technically you can be female, but NPCs will refer to you as male regardless), or class (though the unique \"Gazer\" class of the main character can be developed pretty much like a warrior, mage, healer, or whatever you like)...but you get a lot of options for rounding out your party. You are not limited to taking the recommended party members, and can build your party however you want. You can have 4 teammates of whatever class you want. Want to rely on healing items and skip a designated healer class character? Sure. Want a bunch of deadly, light armored Samurai and Assassins with a healer to protect, buff, and revive them when they do get hit? Its all up to you!\n\nYou can pick race, gender, and class for your party members, and even get to choose from a limited set of voice sounds as well as the character portrait. Be advised, the portraits (and in fact much of the game play) follows the standard JRPG format of scantily clad ladies and slightly risque situations (in addition to standard armor, you can equip/upgrade the characters \"undies\"). I think its totally harmless (and no where near as nauseatingly over-sexualized as games like Dragons Crown), but some may be put off.\n\nThe artwork of the stills is quite nice, and its a shame the battle sequences aren	 fully animated...its decidedly old school and reminds me a bit of games like Phantasy Star. Still, being able to build your party as youd like, equip them with multiple weapons sets that can be switched in combat (to allow melee/ranged attacks if youd like), and the twists with game play such as unlocking the \"demon\" mechanic or equipping artifacts that bestow the abilities of other classes, add enough complexity and strategic sophistication to really make the game engrossing.\n\nThis game is by no means perfect, and doesn	 really break much new ground, but is well put together with fun and challenging game play. While save points are frequent enough to allow pick up/put down gaming (ideal on the Vita), Ive found myself happily sinking a few hours at a time tweaking my characters, selling/stockpiling items, and exploring the many challenging dungeons.',	'2014-07-28 10:57:50',	0,	4),
